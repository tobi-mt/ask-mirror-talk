#   Settings > Build > Docker > Dockerfile Path: Dockerfile.api
#   Settings > Deploy > Healthcheck: Enable, path=/health, timeout=300

# mirror-talk-ingestion service:
#   Settings > Build > Docker > Dockerfile Path: Dockerfile.worker
#   Settings > Deploy > Healthcheck: Disable
#   Settings > Deploy > Start Command: python scripts/bulk_ingest.py --max-episodes 20 --no-confirm
